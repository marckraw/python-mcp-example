# Railway.app Deployment Guide

## Environment Configuration
- Use Railway's environment variables for production secrets
- Set `PORT` environment variable (Railway provides this automatically)
- Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` for external access
- Configure `API_KEY` for authentication in production

## Deployment Structure
- Avoid `Procfile` and `railway.json` - Railway auto-detects Python apps
- Use `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Keep dependencies minimal and focused
- Core dependencies: `fastmcp`, `python-dotenv`

## Server Configuration
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` for external access
- Use `PORT` environment variable from Railway
- Support both authenticated and non-authenticated modes
- Use SSE transport for web deployment

## Best Practices
- Test locally with `.env` file before deploying
- Use `python-dotenv` for development environment management
- Implement proper logging for production debugging
- Design for production from the start
- Consider scalability when choosing transport protocols

## Common Environment Variables
```
PORT=8080                    # Provided by Railway
HOST=0.0.0.0                # Required for external access
API_KEY=your-secret-key     # Optional authentication
SERVER_NAME=MyMCPServer     # Descriptive server name
DEBUG=false                 # Disable debug in production
