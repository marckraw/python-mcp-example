# FastMCP 2.0 Framework Standards

## Primary Framework
- Use FastMCP 2.0 as the primary framework for Model Context Protocol development
- Documentation: https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome
- FastMCP 2.0 is the actively maintained version with comprehensive production-ready features

## Server Creation
- Use `from fastmcp import FastMCP` for server creation
- Prefer FastMCP 2.0 over the official MCP SDK for new projects
- FastMCP provides simpler, more Pythonic interfaces

## Tools and Resources
- Use `@mcp.tool` decorator for creating tools (LLM actions/POST-like operations)
- Use `@mcp.resource("uri")` decorator for creating resources (LLM context/GET-like operations)
- Tools should perform actions and have side effects
- Resources should provide static/reference data for LLM context

## Transport Protocols
- Prefer SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport for web deployments
- Use `mcp.run(transport="sse")` for SSE mode
- Use `mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")` for HTTP streaming when appropriate
- Use `mcp.run()` or `mcp.run(transport="stdio")` for local/stdio mode

## Code Style
- Follow Pythonic conventions and clean code principles
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Include descriptive docstrings for all tools and resources
- Prefer simple, readable implementations over complex ones
